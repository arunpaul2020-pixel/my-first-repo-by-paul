“Spam Classifier: An Intelligent Approach to Filter Unwanted Emails”

In the digital age, email has become a primary mode of communication. However, the prevalence of spam emails has significantly hindered its effectiveness. Our research presents a novel Spam Classifier designed to intelligently filter out these unwanted emails. The classifier leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails with high accuracy. It analyzes various features of an email, including the sender’s information, email content, and metadata. The classifier is trained on a large dataset of labeled emails, ensuring robust performance across diverse email types. Furthermore, it continually learns from new data, adapting to evolving spam tactics. This Spam Classifier aims to enhance the user’s email experience by reducing the intrusion of spam, thereby allowing more efficient and effective communication.
